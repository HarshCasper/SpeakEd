## Project Abstract üôã

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/vidhibhasa/SpeakEd](https://badges.gitter.im/vidhibhasa/SpeakEd.svg)](https://gitter.im/vidhibhasa/SpeakEd?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

SpeakEd is a Community Platform developed for Community Leads and Volunteers as well as Speakers to come on a single Unified Platform leading to greater visibility, helping you to find the right Speaker for your Event. With an integrated Portfolio Feature for Speakers, you would be able to find the Events, Workshops, or Podcasts they have spoken at, and will allow you to contact them at ease in a secure manner. Speakers would be able to build their Portfolio around this, showcasing the speaking skills they have got along with the expertise and clarity that possess while teaching or instructing someone. This Community Application would allow Speakers to connect with Community Leads/Volunteers over their love for Community Building and helping out each other in an effective way, benefitting the Community in the longer run.

## Project Backgroundüí°
As a Community Lead or an Organizer, did you ever feel that you are not able to find the right Speakers for your Event?

Do you have to go on hunts across LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, and even Github to find the Speakers and mail them, requesting them to be Guest speakers for your Event?

SpeakEd aims to be a single, unified platform for people who are looking for Speakers all across the globe with a capability to search Speakers and Mentors who would love to volunteer and be a part of your Event. On top of that, this Platform would allow the Speakers to build a Portfolio for themselves, highlighting the Events and Workshops they have spoken in and help people find them easily and effectively.
